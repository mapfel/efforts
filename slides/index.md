## Introduced FsReveal

- to provide fancy presentations
- neutralized the tWiki presentation from the past
- started to host that version at  
  [http://mapfel.github.io/wiki-presentation](http://mapfel.github.io/wiki-presentation)
- which is the same as  
  [http://blog.apfel.space/wiki-presentation/](http://blog.apfel.space/wiki-presentation/)
- it can be used as the template for company specific presentations
- redirecting of the sub domain was made in the past  
  â†’ have to figure out how

## DocFX

- Microsoft developed documentation tool
- open source successor of SHFB
- allows easily mix code documentation with additional content  
  (e.g. XML Comments, API documentation (OAS), tutorials,...)
- great support for .NET Core projects

---

### Mix XML Comment with Wiki

- currently the XML Comments are merged together with Wiki content
- it is done inside the `docfx.json` file

### Host the DocFX output via GitHub Pages

- used the `apm1grb` account to host the **DocFX** output 
- you can find here: [https://apm1grb.github.io/](https://apm1grb.github.io/)
- technically the content of the `_site` folder was included in an own repo

### Use Git Submodules to link source code together with Wiki content and DocFX pimped source code XML Comments

- realized as sub modules
- checkout of the Wiki repo below `doc` folder 
- checkout of "`_site`-repo" below `doc` folder 
- needs awareness about workflows  
  (when the pull Wiki and to push "`_site`-repo")

---

### Provide complete XML Comments

- completely documented all public and protected interfaces
- re-introduced GhostDoc in toolset
